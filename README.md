Hello everyone! So I've just started with Git and GitHub, and programming in general (self-taught) and this is my first project. I want to start making my portfolio, and I'd really appreciate any kind of suggestion in order to imporving. Thank u very much in advance.
Pd1: I heard in somewhere that it's a best practice to do the @media thing at the beginning, but I believe that is easier to do at the last.
Pd2: I thought in put the images in the .gitignore, but I wasn't sure. It would be better to do that?
Pd3: And I'd appreciate if you can tell me any page or resources in order to improve, too.
