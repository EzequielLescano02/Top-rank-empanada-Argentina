Hello everyone! So I've just started with Git and GitHub, and programming in general (self-taught) and this is my first project. I want to start making my portfolio, and I'd really appreciate any kind of suggestion in order to imporving. Thank u very much in advance.<br>
Pd1: I heard in somewhere that it's a best practice to do the @media thing at the beginning, but I believe that is easier to do at the last.<br>
